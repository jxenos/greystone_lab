The API should allow a client to,
- Create a user
- Create loan
- Fetch loan schedule
- Fetch loan summary for a specific month
- Fetch all loans for a user
- Share loan with another user
A loan record should at least contain the following fields:
- Amount
- Annual Interest Rate
- Loan Term in months
The loan schedule endpoint should return an array of length loan_term,
consisting of:
{
Month: n
Remaining balance: $xxxx,
Monthly payment: $xxx
}
The loan summary endpoint should accept a month number as a parameter
and return:
- Current principal balance at given month
- The aggregate amount of principal already paid
- The aggregate amount of interest already paid
To calculate the above, you will have to code a function that
generates an amortization schedule. There are plenty of libraries that
can do this for you, but for this challenge, please develop the
function yourself. You may use general libraries, such as numpy, if
you would like.
